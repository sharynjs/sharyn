# 🌹 @sharyn/commands

Some command strings, to use alongside with [**@sharyn/scripts**](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn/blob/master/scripts). These are very specific to my personal use, so they will probably not be very useful to you.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @sharyn/commands
# or
yarn add --dev @sharyn/commands
```

Check the [**code directly**](https://github.com/sharynjs/sharyn/blob/master/commands/index.js) to see which commands are available.
